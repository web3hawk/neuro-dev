# Vendor Field Implementation Test

## Changes Made:

### Backend Changes:
1. **Project Model** (`apps/backend/models/project.go`):
   - Added `Vendors string` field with JSON tag `"vendors"`

2. **Request Model** (`apps/backend/models/requests.go`):
   - Added `Vendors string` field to `CreateProjectRequest` struct

3. **Controller** (`apps/backend/controllers/projects_controller.go`):
   - Updated project creation to include `Vendors: req.Vendors`
   - Updated transaction creation to include vendors field

### Frontend Changes:
1. **ProjectCreate Component** (`apps/frontend/src/components/ProjectCreate.tsx`):
   - Added `Select` component import
   - Updated `CreateProjectValues` interface to include `vendors: string[]`
   - Added vendor selection form field with multi-select options:
     - 阿里云 (Alibaba Cloud)
     - 谷歌云 (Google Cloud)
     - 华为云 (Huawei Cloud)
     - 亚马逊云 (Amazon Cloud)
   - Updated form submission to convert vendors array to comma-separated string

## Expected Behavior:
- Users can select multiple vendors from dropdown
- Selected vendors are sent to backend as comma-separated string
- Vendors data is stored in database with project record
- Form validates properly and creates project successfully

## Test Scenarios:
1. Create project with no vendors selected
2. Create project with single vendor selected
3. Create project with multiple vendors selected
4. Verify data is properly stored in database
